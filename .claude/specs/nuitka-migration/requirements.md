# Nuitka Migration and Build Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

This specification covers the migration from PyInstaller to Nuitka for the ClaudeWarp application packaging, along with build optimizations to reduce application size and exclude unnecessary dependencies like click that are not needed for GUI-only builds.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Migration Requirements

**1.1 Replace PyInstaller with Nuitka**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to use Nuitka instead of PyInstaller for application packaging, so that I can produce smaller, faster executable files

  3. The system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing build workflows
  4. The system SHALL support all target platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

**1.2 Optimize Build Configuration**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want optimized Nuitka build configurations, so that the resulting executable is as small and efficient as possible
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL configure Nuitka with optimal flags for GUI applications
  2. The system SHALL enable all applicable size optimization options
  3. The system SHALL exclude unnecessary modules and dependencies
  4. The system SHALL maintain PySide6 plugin integration

### 2. Dependency Optimization Requirements

**2.1 GUI-Only Build Mode**
- **User Story**: As a user, I want a GUI-only executable that doesn't include CLI dependencies, so that the application size is minimized
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL create a GUI-only entry point that excludes CLI modules
  2. The system SHALL exclude typer and click dependencies from GUI builds
  3. The system SHALL maintain full GUI functionality without CLI components
  4. The system SHALL preserve CLI functionality for development/debugging purposes

**2.2 Smart Dependency Analysis**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want the build system to automatically exclude unused dependencies, so that I don't need to manually manage exclusion lists
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL analyze import dependencies and exclude unused modules
  2. The system SHALL provide configurable exclusion lists for common unused libraries
  3. The system SHALL warn about potentially unnecessary inclusions
  4. The system SHALL validate that excluded modules don't break functionality

### 3. Build Configuration Requirements

**3.1 Multi-Platform Support**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want consistent Nuitka builds across all supported platforms, so that deployment is streamlined
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL provide platform-specific Nuitka configurations
  2. The system SHALL maintain app bundle creation for macOS
  3. The system SHALL support single-file executables for Linux/Windows
  4. The system SHALL preserve existing platform-specific optimizations

**3.2 Advanced Optimization Features**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want to leverage Nuitka's advanced optimization features, so that the application runs faster and uses fewer resources
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL enable Nuitka's compilation optimizations
  2. The system SHALL configure link-time optimization where supported
  3. The system SHALL enable dead code elimination
  4. The system SHALL optimize Python bytecode compilation

### 4. Build Script Enhancement Requirements

**4.1 Nuitka Build Script**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want a comprehensive Nuitka build script, so that I can easily build optimized executables
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL provide a new Nuitka build script replacing the PyInstaller version
  2. The system SHALL include size analysis and optimization reporting
  3. The system SHALL support both development and production build modes
  4. The system SHALL integrate with the existing Justfile workflow

**4.2 Build Validation and Testing**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want automated validation of Nuitka builds, so that I can ensure the executable works correctly
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL validate that the built executable launches correctly
  2. The system SHALL verify GUI functionality in the built application
  3. The system SHALL compare build sizes and performance metrics
  4. The system SHALL provide debugging information for build issues

### 5. Configuration Management Requirements

**5.1 Nuitka Configuration Files**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want centralized Nuitka configuration, so that build settings are consistent and maintainable
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL provide Nuitka configuration files for different build types
  2. The system SHALL support environment-specific build configurations
  3. The system SHALL allow easy customization of optimization settings
  4. The system SHALL document all configuration options

**5.2 Dependency Management Integration**
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want Nuitka to integrate with the existing uv dependency management, so that builds use the correct package versions
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The system SHALL use uv for managing Nuitka as a build dependency
  2. The system SHALL ensure Nuitka uses the correct virtual environment
  3. The system SHALL support Nuitka plugin management through uv
  4. The system SHALL maintain dependency isolation during builds

### 6. Performance and Size Requirements

**6.1 Size Optimization Targets**
- **User Story**: As an end user, I want smaller application downloads, so that installation is faster and storage usage is reduced
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The GUI-only build SHALL be at least 20% smaller than the current PyInstaller build
  2. The system SHALL exclude all CLI-related dependencies (typer, click) from GUI builds
  3. The system SHALL provide detailed size reporting and analysis
  4. The system SHALL identify opportunities for further optimization

**6.2 Performance Optimization**
- **User Story**: As an end user, I want faster application startup, so that the GUI is more responsive
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  1. The Nuitka build SHALL have faster startup time than PyInstaller builds
  2. The system SHALL optimize import loading and module initialization
  3. The system SHALL enable native code compilation where beneficial
  4. The system SHALL minimize runtime overhead

### 7. Development Workflow Requirements
